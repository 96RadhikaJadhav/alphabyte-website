## 🚀 How It Works
* `src/` folder contains all the source files.
* `dist/` folder contains generated build files which are to be deployed.
* `src/pages/` folder contains html files corresponding to the pages available on the website.
* `src/sections/` folder contains reusable html files that can be included inside pages. (nav, footer, etc.)
* `src/css/all/` folder contains css files that are included in every html page on the website.
* `src/js/all/` folder contains javascript files that are included in every html page on the website.
* `src/images/` folder contains all images on the website.
* `gulpfile.js` is the [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) config file, in-charge of launching dev server, bulding project, minifying JS and CSS, compressing images, etc.
* `babel.config.json` is the [Babel](http://babeljs.com) config file. Babel allows us to use the latest JavaScript features that might not currently be supported in all browsers.
